C# is the preferred language to build .NET applications. In this course, you will learn the basics of the C# language and create your own C# applications

Beth's Pie Shop HRM

Through this course, we will be building a few applications together. All of these are focused on one of our customers, Bethany. She runs a store where she sells the most amazing pies called Bethany's Pie Shop, and we are building the software for her business. We will be looking at some applications to manage her staff *from Module 7* of this course. The concepts used in this course include employees, managers, wages, taxes, and so on. So, pretty general concepts that should be clear to understand. I am a big fan of doing rather than watching a course. For that reason, the entire course is built so that you can follow along with everything I'm doing. Please try to write the code I'm writing. You will learn a lot this way. To be able to follow along, you'll need the exercise files, which you can find here on the Pluralsight website. Head over to the Exercise files tab to start the download.
